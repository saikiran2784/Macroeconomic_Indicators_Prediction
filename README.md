This project focuses on the prediction of key economic indicators such as unemployment rates, inflation rates, and GDP growth rates using Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) models. The aim is to provide accurate and robust forecasting solutions by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.

Designed and implemented GBR models for predicting economic indicators.
Achieved a minimum of 93% testing accuracy and 95% training accuracy across all models, ensuring consistent and reliable results.
Utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data processing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.
Incorporated at least 4 features per model to capture relevant insights and improve prediction performance.
